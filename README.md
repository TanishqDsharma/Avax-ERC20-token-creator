# Creating the ERC-20 Token:

  1) Lets goto remix and create our mintable token. 
      
      * Visit this link:
       
         ```json
         https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.4+commit.c7e474f2.js to open remix IDE.
         ```

  
  2) You will be having an default workspace, delete that workspace by clicking on delete Icon.
      
      ![alt text](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/Avax-ERC20-token-creator/blob/main/avax-images/w1.png)
  
  3) Now create a new workspace by clicking on add icon 
      
      ![alt text](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/Avax-ERC20-token-creator/blob/main/avax-images/w2.png)
      
      ![alt text](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/Avax-ERC20-token-creator/blob/main/avax-images/a3.png)
       
  4) After this click on file icon to add a file and give a name to your file:
      
      ![alt text](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/Avax-ERC20-token-creator/blob/main/avax-images/a4.png)

  
  5) Since we will use an ERC-20 contract from OpenZeppelin, just paste this line to the file and save.
     
      ```
      import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/presets/ERC20PresetMinterPauser.sol";
      ```
      
      ![alt text](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/Avax-ERC20-token-creator/blob/main/avax-images/w3.png)

  6) Now save the file and you will see a bunch of files imported on remix IDE, this is the feature of remix that allows us to import a GitHub contract repository to remix by just giving the URL-Link. with an import statement.
     
      ![alt text](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/Avax-ERC20-token-creator/blob/main/avax-images/a5.png)

     
  
  7) In these files there is one file named as "ERC20PresetMinterPauser.sol" file,this file is written by OpenZeppelin according to ERC20 standards with minter functionality. After deploying this file, we will be the owner of the contract and thus have the authority and ability to mint the tokens.
     
      ![alt text](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/Avax-ERC20-token-creator/blob/main/avax-images/a6.png)

  
  8) Now in your remix IDE open the "Compiler", which is present in second tab in your remix IDE and and select the solidity version that matches with the solidity version written in file as "pragma solidity â€¦..".The version should be equal to or greater than the file's version.The compiler didn't showed any errors and compiled the file successfully.

  9) Now lets move to the third tab of your remix IDE which is "DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTION.". Before deploying your contract, click on environment and choose "Injected web3".Now metamask wallet pop-up will appear asking you to connect the account, click on connect.

  10) The last thing before the deployment process is to set the contract that will be deployed as a token. Above the Deploy Button, there is a drop-down menu to select a contract. Select the contract named "ERC20PresetMinterPauser.sol".
      
      ![alt text](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/Avax-ERC20-token-creator/blob/main/avax-images/w5.png)

  11) Now, enter the name and symbol of your token in the input fields. I named it as "Mangatoken" and the symbol that I gave is  "MKT".

      Finally, click on "transact button"
      
      ![alt text](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/Avax-ERC20-token-creator/blob/main/avax-images/a8.png)
      

  
  12) After clicking the button, a pop-up will show up and just confirm it.

  13) And then another metamask pop-up will appear asking for confirmation.Confirm it.
      
      ![alt text](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/Avax-ERC20-token-creator/blob/main/avax-images/a10.png)
 
      
  14) We can see our transaction deployed on avalache c-chain using metmask:
      
      1) In your metamask wallet goto "Activity" Tab.
      2) Then select your "contract deployment" transaction.
      3) The metamask wallet will show you your transaction details, to view it on explorer follow the arrow icon:
         
         ![alt text](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/Avax-ERC20-token-creator/blob/main/avax-images/a11.png)

  15) Here we can see all details about the transaction and token contract:
      
      ![alt text](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/Avax-ERC20-token-creator/blob/main/avax-images/a12.png)
      
  16) Now, visit remix IDE again and you will see your contract under deployed contracts.
      
      ![alt text](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/Avax-ERC20-token-creator/blob/main/avax-images/a13.png)
      
  17) Here, we have lot of functions that we can use to interract with our contract but for this tutorial we will use the "mint" function.Enter your address and an amount in WEI and click on "transact" button 
      
      ![alt text](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/Avax-ERC20-token-creator/blob/main/avax-images/a13.png)
      
      <b>Transaction in metamask:</b>
            
      * Select the "mint" transaction:
      ![alt text](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/Avax-ERC20-token-creator/blob/main/avax-images/t4.png)

      ![alt text](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/Avax-ERC20-token-creator/blob/main/avax-images/t5.png)
      
      So, I copied to the address highlighted in the screenshot as i will be needing it to import my token in metamask.
      
  
  18) Now, your tokens wont be visible directly in your metamask wallet so to make your tokens visible in your metamask wallet you have to add them.
      
      On metamask, click to "Add Token" button and select "Custom Token" tab:
